    <p>The New 7 Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2001 to choose Wonders of the World from
        a selection of 200 existing monuments.The popularity poll via free web-based voting and
        telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New 7 Wonders
        Foundation (N7W) based in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 at Estádio
        da Luz in Lisbon. The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was
        possible for people to cast multiple votes.According to John Zogby, founder and current
        President/CEO of the Utica, New York–based polling organization Zogby International, New 7
        Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".
        <br>
        <br>

        The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and
        tried to get more votes cast for it, while others downplayed or criticized the contest.
        After supporting the New 7 Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign by providing
        advice on nominee selection, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
        Organization (UNESCO), bound by its bylaws to record and give equal status to all World Heritage
        Sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again in 2007.
        <br>
        <br>

        The 7 winners were chosen from 21 candidates, which had been whittled down from 77 choices by a
        panel in 2006.
        <br>
        <br>

        The New 7 Wonders Foundation, established in 2001, relied on private donations and the sale of
        broadcast rights and received no public funding. After the final announcement, New 7 Wonders
        said it did not earn anything from the exercise and barely recovered its investment.
        Although N7W describes itself as a not-for-profit organization, the company behind it—the New
        Open World Corporation (NOWC)—is a commercial business. All licensing and sponsorship money is
        paid to NOWC.
        <br>
        <br>

        The foundation ran two subsequent programs: New 7 Wonders of Nature, the subject of voting until
        2011, and New7Wonders Cities, which ended in 2014.

                    Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built
                    across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection
                    against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as
                    the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the
                    first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built
                    and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by
                    the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

                    world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and
                    was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were
                    made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are
                    known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin:
                    Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and

                    pronunciationⓘ was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic
                    period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]

                    Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD
                    600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic
                    period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of
                    styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The
                    presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration
                    or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of
                    these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.</p></details>

                <details><p>Machu Picchu[a] is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on
                    a mountain ridge at 2,430 meters (7,970 ft).[9] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the
                    Incas",[10] it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu
                    District within Urubamba Province[11] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi)
                    northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a
                    canyon with a subtropical mountain climate.[12]

                    The Inca civilization had no written language and following the first encounter by the Spanish
                    soldier Baltasar Ocampo, no Europeans are recorded to have visited the site from the late 16th
                    century until the 19th century. As far as historical knowledge extends, there are no existing
                    written records detailing the site during its period of active use. The names of the buildings,
                    their supposed uses, and their inhabitants, are the product of modern archaeologists based on
                    physical evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style,
                    with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Temple of the Sun, the Temple of
                    the Three Windows, and the Intihuatana. From 1929 to 1971, Machu Picchu underwent extensive
                    restoration and conservation work, including structural stabilization and artifact excavation,
                    driven by government initiatives and research expeditions.[13] Most recent archaeologists believe
                    that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). The Inca
                    built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest.
                    According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c. 1420–1532.[14] Historical
                    research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people
                    themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.[15][16]</p></details>

                    Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan
                    (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah
                    Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a
                    mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the
                    project for another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah
                    Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal
                    complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time
                    to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million).</p></details>
